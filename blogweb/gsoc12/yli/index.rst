Project Description
-------------------
This project aims to develop a PCL based Reconstruction platform--PCLModeler. There are quite a few related libraries and tools for point cloud based reconstruction, like CGAL, Scanalyze, Meshlab and so on. The key reconstruction steps including registration, cleaning up, surface reconstruction, and visualizing are scattered in different places, making it not very easy to get an easy to use reconstruction platform. It will be great if a ready to use reconstruction platform is provided, which will save usersâ€™ efforts a lot from building up a platform from scratch themselves. We believe such a platform will stimulate more researchers and developers to try their new ideas and develop new applications based on PCL.

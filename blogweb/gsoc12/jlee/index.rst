:project: Particle filter on GPU
:mentor: Koen Buys

About me
--------
I am a Master student of 'Visual Computing Laboratory' in School of Computer Science, Kookmin University.

Project Description
-------------------

Particle filters are commonly used in tracking objects in 2D images and 3D point clouds. In the current version of PCL, Ryohei Ueda from Univ. of Toko did successfully implement the particle filter algorithm in pcl::tracking based on OpenMP implementation. Since the particle filter is easy to parallelize, I have the plan to further improve the performance of the particle filter based on CUDA implementation. The improved particle filter based on GPU will be helpful to develop the real-time critical applications with PCL.

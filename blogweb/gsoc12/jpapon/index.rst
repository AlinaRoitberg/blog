About me
--------
I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at Georg-August University of Goettingen in Germany, working as a research assistant in the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience under Prof. Florentin Woergoetter.
 
Project Description
-------------------
This project aims to develop a full featured GUI for visualization and application of the Point Cloud Library's algorithms. Interfaces will be provided for filtering, registration, surface reconstruction, model fitting, and segmentation of point cloud data. The project will leverage the modular nature of the library to create an application which is easy to maintain and extend as the library develops.

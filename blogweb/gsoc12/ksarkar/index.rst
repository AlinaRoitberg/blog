About me
--------
I am a 5th year Dual Degree undergraduate student of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.
I am done with my final semester and expecting to get my degrees in the month of August. 

I am very interested in the field of Computer Vision and Graphics and wish to do higher studies after a year. Before that I will be doing a job as a Software Engineer in Ebay/Paypal Ltd., India.

Project Description
-------------------
The purpose of the project is to Implement and document various drawing functions using VTK in PCL. Drawing functions include primitive drawings such as lines, circles, polygons etc. as well as alpha blended polygons and graphs, both 2D and 3D, for visualizing histograms and other functions.

Roadmap
-------
The boldfaced bullets represent my current position.

* Get familiar with ssh, svn, cmake, ReST and Unix.
* Fill out this page.
* Get familiar with 'modern c++'.
* Know the internal working of PCLVisualizer.
* Finalize the design of the 'Plotter class' I will be developing by PCL developer community.
* *Develop PCLPlotter class - completed; ask for features if you want something to be added*
* Design the 2D drawing class (PCLPainter2D)
* *Develop PCLPainter2D class based on the design- completed; ask for features if you want something to be added*
* **Improve and add additional features to PCLPlotter and PCLPainter2D**
* **Write tutorials**
* Append this roadmap with next immediate goals.

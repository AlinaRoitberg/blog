About me
--------
I am a third year PhD student in the Robotics Embedded Systems Lab at the University of Southern California. In my research I am focusing on perception, N-dimensional data processing and Next-Best-View estimation for robotic applications.

Project Description
-------------------
In this project I propose to implement a state of the art segmentation approach using graphical models and a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm, which results in faster and better segmentations. Furthermore I propose to create a new pcl package ’pcl_ml’ containing the necessary machine learning techniques such as Markov network structures, inference al- gorithms and low level functions in a general way such they can be reused for future applications.

Leica Geosystems Code Sprint
----------------------------

Leica Geosystems is sponsoring the development of open source efficient
compression mechanisms for organized and unorganized 3D point cloud data. The
ultimate goal is to achieve as much compression as possible, and process a few
million points per second on a standard laptop. In addition different lossy vs
lossless compression techniques will be analyzed and compared.

About me
--------

I am a master student at the University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg,
Germany. I am interested in computer vision and machine learning, especially
those topics that are relevant for service robotics. As such, scene and object
congnition, as well as perception for robot localization and navigation is of
main interest for me.

Problem Description
-------------------

The ultimate goal of many roboticists nowadays is to build a general-purpose
service robot that could successfully operate in human environments. A key
enabler for such a robot would be a reliable perception system which can
decompose the robot's environment into meaningful parts that the robot can
reason about. An early step in the perception pipeline is scene segmentation.
This includes discovering both "high-level" (walls, floors, furniture) and
"low-level" (objects) structures. In the current project we will consider the
latter.

The aim of this project is to go beyond simple table-top scenes, where a
limited number of objects lie on a planar surface with little to no occlusions.
We will work on scenes where many objects are stacked, lined up, or piled up,
therefore severely occluding themeselves and the supporting surface. More
difficult scenarios will include segmenting objects in shopping carts, book or
refrigerator shelves.

Roadmap
=======
.. _aichim_roadmap:

Surface reconstruction and point cloud smoothing project planning, as part of the PCL Toyota Code Sprint.

	* try out some simple smoothing mechanisms by using the Kinect:
	
		* static camera and static scene - simple temporal smoothing
		
		* add change detection
		
		* this should give us an understanding of the problems we are facing

	* benchmark already available smoothing algorithms (MeshLab)
	
	* perfect the virtual_scanner with noise and Kinect-like discretization artifacts
	
	* implement a better mesh representation data structure in PCL - check out OpenMesh
	
	* continuously check state-of-the-art literature for ideas (a preliminary list of papers will be posted here soon)

This is currently just a quick sketch that only covers the beginning of the project.

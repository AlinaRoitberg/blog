Roadmap
=======
.. _goleary_roadmap:

Here is a detailed outline of my GSoC project milestones:

* Go over the list of tutorials, find out what is missing

  - List of completed and non-existant tuorials :doc:`here <tutorials>`.

* Build a list of :doc:`interesting classes <interesting>` that require code examples and documentation. For every interesting class:

  - build sample code that shows its usage
  - add usage code snippets to the doxygen documentation
  - write unit tests
  - [optional] verify performance

* Reorganize samples, tutorials, tests by modules. Put link in doxygen modules to tutorial modules.
* Move PCD files into a different directory (repository)

* Reorganize and introduce "how to" simple tutorials

* Optional:

  - user manual for PCL
  - definition of terms: handbook

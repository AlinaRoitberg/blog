Roadmap
-------

Here is a brief outline of my GSoC project milestones:

* Fill out this page
* Implement, test, and document a series of 3D descriptors useful for geometric object recognition
* Design a framework for registration of point models using FPFH-like signatures
* Given a VFH feature space, extend it for the problem of clustering similar models, and detect the correspondences between points
* Design a feature descriptor that incorporates color and geometry for object recognition
* Document, test, write samples for all the above

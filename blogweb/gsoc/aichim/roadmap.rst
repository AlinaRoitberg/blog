Roadmap
=======
.. _aichim_roadmap:

Here is a detailed outline of my GSoC project milestones:

  * Fill out this page

  * Implement, test, and document a series of 3D descriptors useful for geometric object recognition

   - LARK 3D descriptors
   - Point fingerprint descriptors
   - (See http://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=Survey+on+3D+Shape+Descriptors&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)
     
  * Design a framework for registration of point models using FPFH-like signatures

    - Check Slobodan Ilic's paper from CVPR 2010
      (http://campar.cs.tum.edu/Chair/PublicationDetail?pub=drost2010CVPR)

  * Given a VFH feature space, extend it for the problem of clustering similar models, and detect the correspondences between points

  * Design a feature descriptor that incorporates color and geometry for object recognition

  * Document, test, write samples for all the above

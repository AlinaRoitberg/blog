About me
--------

I'm a student at `University of Houston <http://uh.edu>`_.  

My research interests:

* Computer Vision
* Geometric Computing
* Pattern Recognition
* Digital Image Processing



Roadmap
-------

Here is a brief outline of my GSoC project milestones:

* starting from one of the existing methods (or designing one new method), design and implement the surface reconstruction API for texture blending
* work on pefect texture blending for two overlapping surfaces
* add capabilities for surface mesh updates when a new point cloud dataset is added to an existing surface mesh, without recreating the entire mesh. 
* extend the MLS algorithm by providing capabilities for resampling, hole filling, and setSearchSurface

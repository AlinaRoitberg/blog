About me
--------

I'm a student at `International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad <http://iiit.ac.in>`_.  

My interests include:

* Computer Vision
* Computer Graphics
* High Performance Computing



Roadmap
-------

Here is a brief outline of my GSoC project milestones:

* Design a general framework for a search component to be integrated into PCL. It should be an interface to all currently included neighbor search routines.  
* Define methods and parameter sets for performance evaluation of neighbor search in point clouds
* Develop and integrate methods for an automatic search method selection based on the characteristics of point clouds and amount of planned search operations
* Developing of octree-based neighboring search in CUDA
* Integrate CUDA-based neighbor search into the search component

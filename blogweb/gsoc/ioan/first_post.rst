   I finally got PCL compile on my machine. The progress I've done up to now:

	* Installed all the dependecies (except openni - still working on that)
	* Changed several times the Ubuntu distribution - so that I have no nvcc problems
	* Installed the cudaSDK, devDrivers and so on
	* At the moment I started checking the existing CUDA code

   This week will be a full week for me due to ending of the INRIA stage.

   This days I learned how to add content to the developer blogs and today I also added the content.

   Here's a code snippet:

   .. code-block:: c

      // This is a really fun block of code...
      int n = 10;
      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      {
        printf ("%d\n", i);
      }

   And here's an equation:

   .. math::

      ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

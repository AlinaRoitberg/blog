Project summary / Roadmap
-------------------------

To aid in the development of new feature descriptors and registration algorithms, we plan to create a set of tools to 
automatically test different algorithms and compare their speed and effectiveness.  We will then implement several
new feature descriptors and registration techniques that have been proposed in recent scientific literature and 
evaluate them on a set of benchmark data sets.  All new code will be thoroughly documented and tested, and we will
create a series of tutorials to help new users understand how to apply these new features and registration algorithms 
in their own code.

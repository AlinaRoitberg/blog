:project: Surface Reconstruction methods in PCL
:mentor: **Suat Gedikli** (Radu B. Rusu [Zoltan-Csaba Marton, Vincent Rabaud, Michael Dixon])

About me
--------

I'm a student at `UC San Diego <http://www.ucsd.edu>`_.  

My hobbies include:

* Bass Guitar
* Surfing
* Coding
* Debugging
* Writing documentation

Roadmap
-------

Here is a brief outline of my GSoC project milestones:

* Design a common interface (API) for all surface reconstruction methods in PCL
* Extend PCL's libpcl_surface to include the Marching Cubes and Poisson algorithms
* Connect PCL to VTK's surface smoothing algorithms
* Learn what new methods we need to implement by looking at Meshlab (code is GPL - do not take anything from it, just look at the performance of certain algorithms which we can afterwards reimplement from the original papers)
* Unit test, document, provide code samples for each method implemented

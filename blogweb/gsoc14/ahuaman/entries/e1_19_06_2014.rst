   :title: 0. Whetting your appetite: Why superquadrics?

   Superquadrics are a family of geometric shapes that can represent
   a wide array of diverse primitives using a small number of parameters.
   As an example, look at the figure below: The first row depicts 
   5 common household objects. The second row shows the superquadrics
   that more closely resemble them.

   Superquadrics were initially introduced in the computer graphics community
   by Alan Barr [Barr81], but they were later adopted by the robotics community as 
   an effective modelling tool to approximate objects shape. In general, superquadrics
   include superellipsoid and supertoroids, but for most practical uses, we
   care for only superellipsoids. This can be expressed with the following formula:
      
   .. math:: \left( \left(\dfrac{x}{a}\right)^{\frac{2}{\epsilon_{2}}} + \left(\dfrac{y}{b}\right)^{\frac{2}{\epsilon_{2}}} \right) ^{\frac{\epsilon_{2}}{\epsilon_1} } + \left(\dfrac{z}{c}\right)^{\frac{2}{\epsilon_{1}}} = 1
      :label: se_eq
      
   As it can be seen, superellipsoids in their canonical form can be expressed
   by 5 parameters:

   * :math:`a,b,c`: Scaling factors along principal axes
   * :math:`\epsilon_{1}` : Shape factor of the superellipsoid cross section in a plane orthogonal to XY containing the axis Z.
   * :math:`\epsilon_{2}` : Shape factor of the superellipsoid cross section in a plane parallel to XY.


   If a general transformation is considered, then the total number of parameters required
   to define a superellipsoid is 11 (the 6 additional being the rotation and
   translation degrees of freedom :math:`(x,y,z,\rho,\psi,\theta)`)
   
   Expression :eq:`se_eq` shows the implicit equation of the superellipsoids. The parametric
   solution of :eq:`se_eq` can be expressed as:
   

   .. math::
      :nowrap:
      
      \begin{eqnarray*}
      x = a{\cos(\theta)}^{\epsilon_{1}}{\cos(\gamma)}^{\epsilon_{2}} \\
      y = b{\cos(\theta)}^{\epsilon_{1}}{\sin(\gamma)}^{\epsilon_{2}} \\
      z = c{\sin(\theta)}^{\epsilon_{1}}
      \end{eqnarray*}
     

   with :math:`\theta \in [-\phi/2, \phi/2]` and :math:`\gamma \in [-\phi,\phi]`. In our next post we will learn how to generate pointclouds for superellipsoids (which is not as simple as just sampling :math:`\theta` and :math:`\gamma`! Stay tuned :).

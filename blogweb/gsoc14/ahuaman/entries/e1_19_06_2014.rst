   :title: 0. Whetting your appetite: Why superquadrics?

   Superquadrics are a family of geometric shapes that can represent
   a wide array of diverse primitives using a small number of parameters.
   As an example, look at the figure below: The first row depicts 
   5 common household objects. The second row shows the superquadrics
   that more closely resemble them.

   Superquadrics were initially introduced in the computer graphics community
   by Alan Barr, but they were later adopted by the robotics community as 
   an effective modelling tool to approximate objects shape. In general, superquadrics
   include superellipsoid and supertoroids, but for most practical uses, we
   care for only superellipsoids. This can be expressed with the following formula:
   
   
   .. math::
      
      \left( \left(\dfrac{x}{a}\right)^{\frac{2}{\epsilon_{2}}} + \left(\dfrac{y}{b}\right)^{\frac{2}{\epsilon_{2}}} \right) ^{\frac{\epsilon_{2}}{\epsilon_1} } + \left(\dfrac{z}{c}\right)^{\frac{2}{\epsilon_{1}}} = 1

      
      As it can be seen, superellipsoids in their canonical form can be expressed
      by 5 parameters :math:`(a,b,c,\epsilon_{1}, \epsilon_{2})`. If a general
      transformation is considered, then the total number of parameters required
      to define a superellipsoid is 11 (the 6 additional being the rotation and
      translation degrees of freedom :math:`(x,y,z,\rho,\psi,\theta)`)

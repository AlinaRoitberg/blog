:project: Extension of pcl::people module for detecting people in unconventional poses
:mentor: Matteo Munaro

About me
--------
I am a Master's student in the Computer Science department at `Brown University <http://cs.brown.edu/~xlz>`_.

Project description
-------------------

The pcl::people module provides a method for detecting upright people in RGB-D point clouds. We want to improve and extend this module to better detect people in positions other than upright. I will investigate various techniques including ones from selected papers and improve the current algorithm by implementing the techniques for selecting point cloud clusters candidate to belong to a person which are then classified with more sophisticated people detection techniques.

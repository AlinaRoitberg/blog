About me
--------
I am a master student in computer vision at the University
of Burgundy. I am currently a GSoC participant who is
improving the stereo module, adding new algorithms to solve
the stereo correspondence problem.


Project description
-------------------
The main objective in the present project is to implement 
additional stereo matching algorithms, based on local methods
for cost aggregation.

The algorithms are based on the following papers:

[1] Yoon et al., "Locally Adaptive Support-Weight Approach
for Visual Correspondence Search".
[2]Tombari et al., “Segmentation-based adaptive support for
accurate stereo correspondence”.
[3] Min et al., "A revisit to cost aggregation in stereo 
matching: how far can we reduce its computational redundancy”.

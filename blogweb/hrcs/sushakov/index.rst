About me
--------
My name is Sergey and this page is about me and the project on which I intend to work.
I'm a student at the `Lomonosov Moscow State University
<http://graphics.cs.msu.ru/en>`_. I'm engaged in object recognition in 3D point clouds. In addition, I'm fond of casual game development and all that is relevant to computer graphics.
I was fortunate to become a participant of the HRCS, within which I will be working on the recognition problem.
During my work, I will cover here every stage of development and share with you my success, failure and experience.

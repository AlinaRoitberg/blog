About us
--------
Raphael graduated from a 2-year post-master degree in Software Design (`OOTI <http://wwwooti.win.tue.nl/programme/>`_) in October 2010.
Since then, he has been employed as a researcher / software architect at the `Video Coding and Architectures research group <http://vca.ele.tue.nl/>`_, working on a photorealistic 3D reconstruction.

Francisco is currently carrying his final 9-month internship for OOTI withing the VCA group. 
He spent the last 3 months analyzing the structure of Kinfu and is excited to extend it to larger environments.

Both Francisco and Raphael are easy-going people, with a great interest in science and new technologies.

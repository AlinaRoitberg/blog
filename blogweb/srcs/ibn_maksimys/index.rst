About me
--------
My name is Maksim Lukyanchenko. I'm master's student at the Cybernetics Department of the `National Research Nuclear University <http://www.iate.obninsk.ru/node/1983>`_. 
I'm performing my research work at the Laboratory of Computer Graphics of the `Lomonosov Moscow State University <http://graphics.cs.msu.ru/en>`_.
The scope of my research interests include computer vision, three-dimensional reconstruction and robotics. 
My last work is related to the possibility of `using three-dimensional reconstruction at nuclear power plants <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiMJyu6-dtg>`_.
I think that participation at the PCL-SRCS will help me expand my knowledge in the areas of interest, as well as improve the programmer's skills. 
During my work, I will cover here every stage of development and share with you my success, failure and experience.

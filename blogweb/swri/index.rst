SwRI/NIST Code Sprint
---------------------

The Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), are sponsoring a new PCL code sprint! The efforts will
be focused on developing algorithms for human detection and tracking, out of 2D
camera imagery fused with 3D point cloud data (coming from ASUS XtionPRO
cameras).

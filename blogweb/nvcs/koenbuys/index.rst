:project: Implenting People detection algorithm in PCL and extend with estimator/tracking
:mentor: Anatoly Baksheev

About me
--------
I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Leuven doing research on people detection and tracking and I'm currently also a GSOC mentor. 
I have a master in embedded electronics - ICT. I interned at Willow Garage last year to develop a human detection algorithm after the implementation of J. Shotton.

Big part of this project will be integrating my past work in human detection into the trunk of PCL.
For the code sprint I will expand this with a estimator algoritm taking care of the temporal consistency.
Also the training code will be converted into PCL.

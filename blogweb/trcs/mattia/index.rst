About me
--------
I recently achieved my Masters Degree in Automation and Control Systems studying one year at the Marche Polytechnic University in Italy, and one year at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

During my master's thesis I used for the first time the Point Cloud Libraries. The thesis entitled "Stereo Vision Based Object Detection for Mobile Robots", was mostly aimed at the recognition of obstacles using stereo vision in an outdoor environment (in particular a forest scenario). 
Thanks to this work, I raised a big interest for the problems related to the use of point clouds to describe the environment.


Roadmap
-------

* Know more about the repository, REsT and organize the workspace.
* Make contact with Florentinus to discuss about ideas and goals.
* Make contact with the mentor(s) to know more about the state of the art in point cloud filtering.
* Prepare a software tool to easily test the algorithms. 
* Collect different datasets for algorithm testing.
* Report and document the existing filtering methods in PCL for this sprint purposes.
* Brainstorm with the mentors for new filtering ideas.
* Clustering/Segmentation of the cloud for noise recognition.

 * Test SVM and kNN for cluster classification.
 * Elaborate a localizer for a faster cloud decomposition and noise localization.
 
* Study 2D segmentation algorithms for a pre-segmentation of organized clouds.
* Build up a final pipeline for an automated noise filtering.
* Code optimization.

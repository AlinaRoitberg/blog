About me
--------
I am an Electrical Engineering student at the Eindhoven University of Technology where I am part of the `Video Coding and Architectures research group <http://vca.ele.tue.nl/>`_.
Here I work on a project that some day will realize an end-to-end system of a robot autonomously performing HD 3D mapping of an environment.

I am easy to entertain and in my spare time will always find ways to have a lot of fun, though the vast majority of these ways would not have been made possible without the scientific achievements of the human race to date.
Yay science!

Roadmap
-------

A more detailed roadmap can be found :ref:`here <florentinus_roadmap>`.

  * Familiarize myself with Automated Noise Filtering and the TRCS.
  * Test the current PCL filters on the Trimble data sets.
  * Bugfix, patch and enhance the PCL filters module.
  * Give shape to the ANF system.
  * Implementation of the ANF system.
  * Other things to do after full system is working:

    - Implement the MixedPixel class in PCL.
    - Work on the filters module clean up.
    - Look into the possibilities of a weighting system and SRAM.

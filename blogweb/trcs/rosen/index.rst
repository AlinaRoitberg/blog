About me
--------
I'm a Technical Director at `DreamWorks Animation <http://www.dreamworksanimation.com>`_
working on *"How to Train Your Dragon 2"*.  I'm currently in the Crowds
department supporting the needs of production artists, pipeline and crowds
technology.

Prior to DreamWorks I worked at `CIS <http://www.methodstudios.com/>`_ a visual
effects studio in Vancouver.  While there I worked with many talented veterans
as a Pipeline/Show TD helping integrate and develop a preexisting pipeline at a
new studio for feature film production.

Before moving to Vancouver I worked at `Nanotoon Entertainment <http://www.nanotoon.com>`_
as a Lead/Supervising TD on the film *"Molecules to the Max!"*, an IMAX feature
animated film.  I helped setup and develop for the first time a naive visual
effects pipeline.  In the process I touched all aspects of production including
the development of molecular visualization software for use in Maya.

I graduated from `Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute <http://rpi.edu/>`_ (RPI) in
2005, with a dual major in Computer Science and Electronic Media Arts and
Communications.  My senior year I had an internship with Nanotoon working on
*"The Molecularium"* with some of the most inspiring people which threw me into
the world of computer graphics and visual effects.

About me
--------
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Imaging Science (started from Sep. 2010) from Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York. I have various engineering backgrounds. All kinds of imaging processing techniques are interesting to me.

I work with Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Lab at RIT.  My focus is mainly on 3D building reconstruction from both LIDAR and imagery.

About me
--------
I'm a PhD candidate at the "Automation and Control Institute" (ACIN) at the University of Technology in Vienna. My topics for the thesis, which hopefully writes itself soon, are 3D- reconstruction, object tracking and learning physical behaviour. All in a cognitive framework. I'm payed by the European project: "CogX - Cognitive Systems that Self-Understand and Self-Extend" (EU FP7 ICT, http://cogx.eu).

Source code, videos, publications and of course a little more info about my person are available here:

Roadmap
-------
* B-Spline fitting algorithm.
* Optimization using NURBS.
